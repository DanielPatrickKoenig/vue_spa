# Vuejs Single Page App Testing

Playing around with Vue.js to get familiar with SPA patterns using Vue.js as the VM renderer. Includes technologies/tools like Node.js, Express, Webpack, NPM, and ESLint. 

## Getting Started

You'll want to make sure to be familiar with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Read up on Node.js modules [Node.js Modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)

Node.js http server Express [Express intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

Understand how to use Node Package Manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Webpack basics [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) polyfill for transpiling es6(es2015) down to es5

Bulma low-overhead css framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) using SASS preprocessing

ESLint and the standard rules [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/)

* 2 spaces – for indentation
* Single quotes for strings – except to avoid escaping
* No unused variables – this one catches tons of bugs!
* No semicolons – It's fine. Really!
* Never start a line with (, [, or `
* This is the only gotcha with omitting semicolons – automatically checked for you!
* More details
* Space after keywords if (condition) { ... }
* Space after function name function name (arg) { ... }
* Always use === instead of == – but obj == null is allowed to check null || undefined.
* Always handle the node.js err function parameter
* Always prefix browser globals with window – except document and navigator are okay
* Prevents accidental use of poorly-named browser globals like open, length, event, and name.
* And more goodness – give standard a try today!
